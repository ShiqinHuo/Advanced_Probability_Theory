# Advanced Probability Theory & Modelling

### Aim
This repo is created to opensource some electronic books involving **Advanced Probability Theory & Modelling**</br>
which I collected when I was struggling with the assignments of such a conceptual advanced</br>
mathematics course.

### Category:
1. Probability Spaces, Measure & σ-algebras
2. Random variables and their distribution
3. Independence and product measures
4. Integration and the (mathematical) expectation
5. The Borel-Cantelli lemmas
6. Poisson approximation and the Poisson process
7. English Textbooks in Advanced Probability Theory
8. Chinese Textbooks in Advanced Probability Theory

6. My personal notes and reflection

### List of the materials uploaded:

As long as the opensource materials infringe on someone's copyright, I would delete it at once.

All materials in this repo are uploaded for educational purposes only. Do NOT spread it for any commercial 
purpose.
